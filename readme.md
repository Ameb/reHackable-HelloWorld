## reHackable-HelloWorld
This is actually a very first version of 'reHackable-launcher', which has the objective to offer an interface to launch other utilities/bash scripts from an interface appart from Xochitl.

Built with QtCreator. I followed [this guide for the RPi](http://www.jumpnowtek.com/rpi/Qt-Creator-Setup-for-RPi-cross-development.html) to setup the [toolchain offered by reMarkable](https://remarkable.engineering/deploy/sdk/) in Qt Creator.
